Report on Sexual Harassment Categorization

Introduction:
Sexual harassment is a pervasive issue that can occur in various forms and settings, including workplaces, educational institutions, public spaces, and online platforms. Categorizing and understanding different types of sexual harassment is crucial for effective prevention, intervention, and policy development.

Objective:
The objective of this report is to provide a brief overview of categorizations of sexual harassment based on common factors such as behavior, intent, and impact.

Types of Sexual Harassment:
1. **Verbal Harassment:**
   - Involves unwelcome verbal comments, jokes, innuendos, or propositions of a sexual nature.
   - Examples include sexually explicit remarks, sexual advances, and derogatory remarks about a person's gender or sexual orientation.

2. Non-Verbal Harassment:
   - Encompasses unwanted physical gestures, leering, obscene gestures, or suggestive body language.
   - Examples include staring, winking, licking lips, or making sexually suggestive gestures.

3. Physical Harassment:
   - Involves unwanted physical contact or advances, including touching, grabbing, groping, or hugging without consent.
   - Examples include inappropriate touching of body parts, brushing against someone in a sexual manner, or cornering someone in a confined space.

4. Visual Harassment:
   - Includes displaying or sharing sexually explicit images, videos, or materials without consent.
   - Examples include sending unsolicited sexually explicit emails, sharing pornographic content, or posting inappropriate images online.

5. Cyber Harassment:
   - Occurs through electronic communication channels such as social media, messaging platforms, or email.
   - Includes online stalking, harassment, bullying, or intimidation of a sexual nature.
   - Examples include sending sexually explicit messages, spreading rumors or lies about someone's sexual behavior, or sharing intimate images without consent (revenge porn).

 Now our model categorized into three forms likely:
                                                  1.Commenting,
                                                  2.Ogling/Facial Expressions/Staring,
                                                  3.Touching /Groping.
So the given data can be categorized by 0's and 1's accordingly
If a girl/woman reported that she was commented by a group of people then this can be categorized as 1,0,0.
So by this pattern various percentage categorization is done.
For example:
             1. If the pattern is 1,0,0 the percentage will be 25% and it can be come under 'Starring' 
             2.If the pattern is 0,1,0 the percentage will be 35-65% and it can be come under 'commenting'
             3.If the pattern is 0,0,1 the percentage will be =>65% and it can be come under 'Attempt Rape'
Likewise there are 2^3 combinations are trained through this ML model,so the accurecy rate will be approx 80%.
And this all process is updated in a webpage and can be linked to the cybercrime office server,so the problem can be categorized and intimated imidetiatly to respective officer to be solved.
